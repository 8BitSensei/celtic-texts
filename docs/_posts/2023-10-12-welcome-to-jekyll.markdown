I've thrown together this single website on Github-pages because it came to my attention earlier today that the primary site many rely on to acess Celtic literature, maryjones.us has had an increasing number of dead links causing difficulty for anyone wanting to access texts. I will be slowly adding texts from that site on to here, the benefit of using github is high reliability, open source, and community development.
