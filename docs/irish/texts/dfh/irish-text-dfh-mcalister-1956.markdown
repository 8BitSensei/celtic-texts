Incipit of the princedoms of Ireland, and of their times, from the era of the Sons of Míl to the time of Túathal Techtmar.

In the Fourth Age of the World the Gáedil came into Ireland, that is, in the age of David son of Isa, by whom the Temple of Solomon was projected; and in the twentieth year of the princedom imperii regis Assyriorum. On Thursday, as regards the day of the week, on the Kalends of May, as regards the day of the solar month.

Battle is joined in Tailtiu between the Sons of Míl and the Túatha Dé Dannan, till the three kings of the Túatha Dé Danann fell there, with their three queens. Mac Cécht fell at the hands of Érimón, Mac Cuill of Éber, Mac Gréine of Amorgen, Érin of Suirge, Banba of Caicher, Fotla of Étan.

In the year after that, the building of Dún Etair by Suirge, of Dún Finne by Caicher, of Delginis of Cualu by Sétga, and of Dún Náir in Sliab Modoirn by Goisten.

At the end of a year after that—[that is, after the battle of Tailtiu], a battle was fought between Érimón and Éber in the plain of Airgetros, in contention for Druim Clasaig in Ui Maine, Druim Bethaig in Moenmag, and Druim Fingini in Mumu, for their fruitfulness. Éber Find son of Míl fell in that battle, and there fell on teh other side Goisten, Sétga, Surge, the three chieftains.

Érimón took the kingship of Ireland, and two royal forts were dug by him — Ráith Oind in the land of Cualu, and Ráith Bethaig above the Nore. He gave the kingship of the province of the Gailioin to Crimthann Sciathbél of the Domnann; he gave the kingship of Mumu to the four sons of Éber--Ér, Orba, Fergna, Féron. He gave the kingship of the province of Connachta to Ún son of Uicce, and to Etán; he gave the kingship of the province of Ulaid to Éber son of Ír, a quo the Ulaid of Emain.

At that time came the Cruithne, and landed in Inber Sláine in Ui Cendselaig. Crimthann suffered them to come to him, for the remedy which a druid of the Cruithne found for him, for fighting against the Túath Fidga, a people of the Britons. Everyone on whom they would inflict a wound was doomed, and they would handle nothing but poisoned weapons. This is the remedy; to pour the milk of six score hornless white kine into the trenches where the battle should be fought; unde the Battle of Árd Lemnachta. By means of that device all the Túath Fidga perished.

1. Ard Lemnachta, which is a region in the South,
let every one who is a sage find out,
wherefore did the name and appellation adhere to it
that fastened upon it after the time of Crimthann?
2. Crimthann Seiathbel, it is he who undertook
to save them from hard battle,
to protect them from the venoms of their weapons,
weapons of the terrible bitter giants.

3. Six men of the Cruithne whom God appointed
came from the land of Thracia,
Solen, Ulpa, noble Nechtan,
Oengus, Letenn and Drostan.

4. God bestowed upon them by means of cattle
to protect and satisfy them from their sickness,
to protect them from the venom of their weapons,
weapons of the terrible bitter giants.

5. This is the knowledge which he found for them,
he, druid of the Cruithne, it was not unjust,
thrice fifty hornless kine from the plain
to milk for him into one trench.

6. The battle was set closely
about the trench in which was the milk;
he broke the battle valorously
upon the vassals of lofty Banba.

Thus Cathluan son of Cing, of the Cruithne, assumed great power over Ireland, till Érimón drave him out.

It is then that Cruithnechán son of Cing came to seek wives of Érimón; and Érimón gave him the wives of the men who were drowned at the Sandhills, namely Bres and Buas and Buaigne; and the surety of sun and moon against them that land should be taken [i.e. inherited] no less from the men among the Cruithne-folk than from women for ever.]

In that time of Érimón, the building of Dún Sobairce and Dún Cermna and Dún Binni and Carraig Brachaide in Murbolg, by Mantán son of Caicher; and the building of the Causeway of Inber Mór in the land of Ui Enechlais of Cualu by Amorgen son of Míl; and the building of Ráith Sailech in Fánat by Fulmán, and of Ráith Rigbaird in Muiresc by Étan s. Oicce, and of Ráith Croich in Árd Eitig by Ún s. Uicce. In this time was the burst of the seven Ríges of Laigin, of the seven Brosnas of Éile, of Eithne in Ui Néill, and of the three Sues in Connachta, also of Loch Riach, and Loch Réin, and of Loch Cimme and Loch Finnmaige in Connachta, of Loch Dá Cáech in Laigin, of Loch Laig in Ulaid, of Loch Buadach in Cera and of Loch Gréine. Of those matters the poet chanted thus —

1. In the time of Eremon the wise
the founding, with displays of husbandry,
of showery Dun Sobairce,
of Dún Binne and D†n Cermnai.
2. Dug by him were two forts of a great lord,
in Airgetros keen and wild;
at the Fortress of famous Crofhind,
Ráith Ainninn, and Ráith Bethaig.

3. The founding of the Causeway of the Flood-tower
no tuneful road and bugle,
a road of great inlets in the South with smilings--(?)
Inber Mor in the border of Cualu.

4. The founding of the crooked Rock
of Bladraige of the generous sea;
the burst of nine Ríges about Brosmag,
the burst of nine Brosnas of Eile.

5. The burst of Eithne over the locks of Bith,
the burst of the three Suc-streams;
a binding of hostages beneath a right of course
and a burst of seven lakes.

6. Loch Laiglinne by which he was drowned,
Loch Cime with hundreds of mists,
Loch Da Caech, a progress without rapine,
spacious Loch Rein, Loch Riach.

7. The queen of our troop, swarthy, masterful,
swift, of lasting renown, a seed without display,
although she settled in a fitting territory (?)
it was comely in her time.

A battle is fought between Amorgen and Caicher in Cúl Caichir, and Caicher fell there. A battle is fought between Érimón and Amorgen, namely the battle of Bile Tened in Mide, and Amorgen, the judge and poet, fell there. The battle of Comraire broke before Érimón, wherein fell Én and Étán, the two sons of Oicce, and Ún son of Uicce.

Thereafter Érimón died in Airgetros, and his grave was dug there, and his stone was set up, at Eaitli Bethaig over the Nore, at the end of seventeen years of his reign; wherefore Eoehaid chanted of him —

1. Prince Erimon the youthful warrior,
his tomb was dug after a time of death
in the silvery land of Ros Airget,
on Mag Cetne of charioteers.
The Kings After Érimón

II. MUIMNE, LUIGNE, LAIGNE.
And his three sons took the kingship of Ireland, namely Muimne, Luigne, and Laigne; and they divided Ireland into three parts. Muimne died of plague in Gruachu. Luigne and Laigne fell in the battle of Árd Ladrann at the hands of the sons of Éber, Ér, Orba, Ferón, Fergna, in the third year of their reign.

A season had they in the kingship, till they fell at the hands of Íriel Fáid son of Érimón.

And seven royal forts were dug by him—Ráith Croich in Mag nInis, Ráith Baehair in Latharna, Ráith Chuingeda in Seimne, Ráith Modig, Ráith Buirg in Slechta, Ráith Loichit in Glascharn. Íriel fought the battle of Árd Inmaith in Tethba, wherein Suirge son of Dub fell. He broke the battle of Tenmag against Eochaid Echcenn, kimg of the Fomoire, and the battle of Loehmag. where Lug Roith son of Mofemis fell. Íriel died in Mag Muaide, in the tenth year of his reign, as the historian chanted--

son of the king of Fotla of curling hair,
king of Sliab Mis, king of Macha

were the three sons of Odba without immodesty;

It is there that he died, at the hands of Conmáel. Of the deaths of these chieftains down to this the historian chanted thus--

1. The chiefs of the expedition oversea
when the Sons of Mil came,
their names and their fates
shall be a memory with me for many days.

6. Brego died in tuneful Brega,
Muirthemne died at the Great Pool,
Cuailnge and Fúat, without their being weak,
The Túatha Dé Danann slew them.

7. Cualu fell, I conceal it not,

12. Luigne and Laigne fell

13. The four sons of Eber yonder

in the sad battle of Geisill;
there, briefly and fittingly,
the death of the leaders of the hero-expedition

18. Christ, [who art] above the clans, remember
the grandson of Flann, from heroic Luigne;
King of adornments and of judgements,
Thou art the Abbot, Thou the Chief.

Of him the historian chanted this song--

1. Ethriel son of Iriel, it was heard,
twenty years had he in princedom;
till he fell on the plain of the strong side
by the hand of Conmáel with whom he combated.
2. He smoothed, great was the victory--
he, grandson of Erimon of red arms,
every one around him being laid low by his hand--
the seven plains of great beauty.

3. Mag Belaig, which was never soft,
Mag nGeisille in the land of the Gailioin,

4. In the province of the Ulaid firmly
he smoothed a wood and a sloping valley;
Rothmag in the distant land of Coba,
Lochmag did Ethriel smooth.

VI. CONMÁEL.
Conmáel son of Éber, the first king of Ireland from Mumu, broke twenty-five battles against the seed of Érimón, and was thirty years in the kingship of Ireland, till Tigernmas slew him, in the battle of Óenach Macha, in revenge for his father and his grandfather. Of him the historian chanted—

1. Conmáel, the first prince out of Mumu
over Ireland, it was fitting,
Ethriel fell, with his good-will
and Follach, son of Ethriel.
2. He broke, by force of gory sword,
upon the noble seed of Érimón.
the battles of Eile, of speckled Berre,
and of Sliab Betha of speckled booths.

3. The battles of Ucha, of crooked Cnucha,
of boggy Sliab Moduirn;
early in the battle of Modorn
fell Semroth. noble son of Inboth.

4. The battles of Cliar, of clear Carn Mór--
where Follach the keen fell;
of Loch Léin--he broke it swiftly
against Mug Roith son of Mofebis.

5. For a space of thirty fortunate years
submission was paid to the son of Eber;
he fell in battle afterwards
before Tigernmas son of Ollach.

6. The Eoganachta together,
the Cianachta, the Gailenga, the Luigne,
Dál Cais, Ui Echach with beauty--
those are the descendants of Conmáel.

Tigernmas son of Follach took the kingship thereafter, and broke thrice nine battles—before the end of a year against the progeny of Éber. By him were [drinking] horns first given in Ireland. By him was gold first smelted in Ireland, and colours were put upon garments, and fringes. By him were made ornaments and brooches of gold and silver. Iuchadán was the name of the wright who smelted the gold, in Foithri of Airther Life. And he was seventy and seven years in the kingship of Ireland, and he came but little short of destroying the progeny of Éber during that time. So he died in Mag Slecht, in the great Assembly thereof, with three-fourths of the men of Ireland in his company, in worship of Crom Cruaich, the king-idol of Ireland; so that there escaped thence, in that fashion, not more than one-fourth of the men of Ireland; unde Mag Slecht. In his time was the outburst of seven lakes—Loch Ailine and Loch Ce in Connachta, Loch Uair in Mide, Loch Febail in TÍr Eogain, Loch Silend in Cairpre, Loch Gabor in Brega, Dabal in Airgialla. The three black rivers of Ireland, Fubna, Torann, Callann.

VIII. EOCHU EDGATHACH.
The fourth of the men of Ireland who escaped gave the kingship of Eochu Édgathach son of Daire Doimthech of the seed of Lugaid son of Íth. By him were made the manifold cheekerings upon the garments of Ireland—one colour in the garment of slaves, two in the garments of peasants, three in those of hirelings and fighting men, four in those of lordings, five in those of chieftains, six in those of men of learning and of poets, and seven in those of kings and of queens. From that there developed all the colours that are today in the vesture of a bishop. Unde cecinit Gilla Coemgen,

1. Tigernmas son of lofty Follach
prince over Banba of rough judgements,
seven and seventy years
in kingship over the Gáedil.
2. By him were smelted, it is a tuneful fame,
ornaments of gold at first in Ireland;
green, blue, purple together,
by him were put upon garments.

3. By his hand fair Conmáel fell,
the first king of Ireland from Mumu;
twenty-seven battles he broke
on the progeny of horny-skinned Conmáel.

4. The battle of Eile, evil was its ordering,
where the king Rochorp fell;
the battle of Lochmag, without smoothness,
where Dagerne fell.

5. The battle of Cúl Ard with valour
and the battle of Cúl Fróecháin;
very great fury was the coming thither--
the battles of Mag Techt, of Commar.

6. The battle of Cúl Athguirt, westward, then;
the battle of Ard Niad in Connachta;
the battle of Carn Feradaig of deeds;
the battle of Cnámhchoill in Connachta.

7. The battle of Cúl Feda of clear causes,
the cruel battle of Congnach,
the battle of Tethba--strong was its excitement--
the battle of Cluain Min of Muirisc.

8. Two battles of Cúl I have together,
the battles of Eile and of Berre;
also seven battles, it is no falsehood,
at Loch Luigdech in one day.

9. Two other battles, as it was heard,
in the one hour, in Argatros;
three battles against the Fir Bolg,
a battle against the Erna--it was no women's ordering.

10. Yonder in the time of Tigernmas,
there broke forth seven lake-bursts;
Loch Uair in Mide, in clear manner,
Loch Cé and Loch Ailinde.

11. Loch Silenn in fair Cairpre,
Loch Febail in Tír Eogain,
Loch Gabair of the bountiful king;
the burst of Daball in Airgialla.

12. The burst of three black rivers there,
Fubna, Torann, and Callann,
about Mag Slecht in strong Breifne.
the noble death of Tigernmas.

13. The men of Alba, the Laigne, Conn's Half,
the progeny of Lugaid in Liathdruim,
Eogan, the progeny of Conall Cas,
those are the seed of Tigernmas.

14. He who was king afterwards,
was Eochu son of Dáire Doimthech,
four years over Banba
was the lord strong.

15. Christ with the power and the renown,
strong over every very pure king,
Prince of the great Nine Grades of Heaven,
King of the Earth with fruitfulness.

IX. SOBAIRCE AND CERMNA.
Sobairce and Cermna Finn took the kingship of Ireland — the two sons of Ebric s. Éber s. Ír of the Ulaid; the first kings of Ireland from the Ulaid. They divided Ireland into two, each of them from his fort; Dún Sobairce and Dún Cermna. It is by Cermna that Eochu Édgathach fell, in the battle of Temair. They were forty years in the kingship. Sobairce fell at the hands of Eochu Menn, son of the king of the Fomoire; Cermna Finn fell at the hand of Eochu Fáebarglas son of Conmáel, in the battle of Dún Cermna, ut dicitur

The death of Sobairce in his fort
by Eochu Menu across the rampart;
the death of Cermna in the crooked battle
by Eochu Finn Fáebarglas.
1. Dun Sobairce, a swift pool of hosts,
the sea to the Red Poi)it lies beneath it;
a face against the great sea I vaunt,
a pleasant protection ever Ireland.

2. Watchdogs of Emain for whom it was a place
assembly-tower of wrath against oppression;.
with valorous multitudes of heroes,
from the glorious fortresses of Ulaid.

3. A place wherein was the queen of a mighty man,
of Celtchair of wolf-packs, a prudent champion,
Findabar, white was her bright smile,
besides being a woman she was a warrior.

4. The true place, truly good, of Fodla,
a protection of laws, well-guarding, shapely,
a wall which the paths of the great sea used to serve,
a fort where the warriors of Emain used to be.

5. A few Ulaid came,
a people by whom princes were subdued,
they purged its true woodland mane,
the royal hosts of [Dál] Riada took it.

6. I speak of the choice troop of kings,
the lasting glory of Conaire, slender and fair;
a progeny, according to truth, as I relate
of a king who took pleasant Ireland.

7. For it is Patrick who taught,
it is he by whom their fruits were apportioned;
he saluted a pair with great fame
of the seed of Erc and of Olchu.

8. When that the son of Calpurn blessed it
he found a homestead for his noble children;
a fort with breadth over the pool of crews--
never will foreigners plough it.

9. The apostle of Ireland, after renewal,
a clear stately ascent of the King of Mystery;
the son of Calpurn, gold of our sainthood,
with the valorous king Cermna.

10. Sobairce of hosts, of spears,
a foreshadowing of the household of Temair(?)--
the landscape of tuneful Banba was divided by him
with the valorous king Cermna.

11. So that their two trusty forts are
a discernment of mysteries with followings of courses
over the laughing wave, against its thunder
there, on the two borders of Ireland.

12. Dún Sobairce of spears is
a sally-port of support of Ulaid;
Dún Cermna, which is not narrow, is concealed
southward on the lively sea of Mumu.

13. Good the two kings whom I reckon,
true princes as I relate;
with poetic strength they were worthy,
they were high kings over Ireland.

14. A season before the time of battle of weapons,
of Nuadu of Fál, of the household of Temair,
her clean white lawns were shared
between Sobairce and Cermna.

15. The appearance of her champions
long after the time of the Sons of Míl, is good sense;
upon our land, as it is related,
homage was paid to the troop of forts.

16. Two steadfast rocks, two enduring gryphons,
two brethren with rich virtue,
two precious stones with noble strength,
chieftains over noble Ireland.

17. Most noble among kings, the King of the Sun
quenched them to the dust;
though very long was their reign,
of the generation of the chief of the Fort.

18. Let us adore the White King of the Sun,
guide of my reason to an hundred mysteries,
who hath spread abroad every grace, every kingdom,
who hath fashioned the generation of every man.

X. EOCHU FÁEBARGLAS.
Eochu Fáebarglas son of Conmáel took the kingship of Ireland. It is he who broke the battles of Luachair Dedaid and of Fossad Dá Gort against the children of Érimón, and of Comair Trí nUisci and of Tuaim Dreccon [and] of Druim Liathain. It is there that Smirgoll s. Enboth s. Tigemmas fell. Seven plains were cleared by him: Mag Smerthach in Ui Failge, Mag nAidne and Mag Luirg in Connachta, Mag Emir and Mag Lemna and Mag Fubna and Mag Dá Gabal; in Airgialla are they. Eochu fell at the hands of FÍacha Labrainne s. Smirgoll s. Smerthach s. Enboth s. Tigernmas, in the battle of Carman, in revenge for his father; unde poet a cecinit

1. Eochu, Edge of the Warrior-band,
was no danger to his generation;
the grandson of Eber spent afterwards
twenty years in the kingship.
2. By his hand there fell without sloth
Cermna, of Fál, clear his understanding;
and Inboth, grandson of Follach,
in the battle of the Meeting of Three Waters.

3. The battle of Fossad Dá Gort of warriors,
the battle of furious Tuaim Dreccon;
against Smirgoll with his peoples,
he broke the battle of Luachair Dedad.

4. There fell by Eochu the terrible
the grandson of Tigernmas of the kingly hands,
the son of Inboth, Smirgoll the wealthy,
in the fight of Druim Liatháin.

5. Cleared by him smoothly
were seven plains right and fitting;
Mag Smethrach in Ui Failge,
Mag Luirg and Mag nAidne.

6. Mag Lemna and Mag nEnir,
Mag Fubna, white its seat;
by the Son of Conmáel with purity
on the side of Mag Dá Gabal.

7. By the son of Smirgoll with brilliance,
Fiacha Labrainne with diligence,
there fell, when he was off his guard,
Eochu, Edge of the Warrior-band.

XII. EOCHU MUMU.
Eochu Mumu son of Mofebis took the kingship of Ireland, from whom is Mumu named; and he broke many battles against the children of Érimón. He was twenty-one years in the kingship, till he fell at the hands of Óengus Olmucach son of Fíachu Labrainne, in a fair fight. This is why he was called Olmuccaid; the daughter of Mogaeth Mór-ólach (the great drinker), son of Mofebis, was his mother, and she gave great drinkings; or "the great drink of Mogaeth", etc.

XIII. ÓENGUS OLMUCAID.
Óengus Olmucaid s. Fiacha took the kingship of Ireland, and broke the battles of Cliar, of Cuirche, and óf Sliab Cailge in the territory of Corco Baiscinn--against the Mairthine was it broken--and the battle of Glas Fráecháin in which Fráechan Fáid fell. Also he broke fifty battles against the Cimithentuath, and against the Fir Bolg; twelve battles against the Longobardi; and four against the Colosi; the battle of Cuil Ratha in Desmumu against the Martra, and the battle of Carn Richeda against the Martra in addition; the battle of Sliab Cua against the Ema; and the battle of Ard Achaid, in which Smirgoll s. Smethra king of the Fomoire fell. In his time was the burst of Loch Oenbeithe in Ui Cremthainn, and of Loch Sailech, and of Loch Cassan, and the seaburst between Eba and Rosceite in Ui Flachrach. Seven plains were cleared by him--Mag nÓensciath in Laigin, Mag Glinni Dechon in Cenél Conaill, Mag Cúli Coel in Cenél Bogaitie, Ailmag in Callraige, Mag Mucrima and Mag Luirg in Connachta, Mag Luachra Dedad, Mag Arcaill in Ciarraige Luachra. Thereof the historian sang--

1. Óengus Olmucaid the glorious
was king for great Banba
thrice seven years, without jealousy
after slaying Eochu Mumu.
2. Good was the king, a choice of a prince
by whom an hundred cruel battles were broken;
along with the fifty, with fortune,
which he broke against the men of Alba.

3. He broke twelve battles afterwards
in Italy against the Lombards;
by Oengus of Macha, without folly,
four battles against the Colais.

4. The battle of Cliar, the battle of crooked Cuirche,
the battle of Sliab Cailce of great stakes,
the battle of Ros Fraechain with points of javelins,
and the battle of Carn Richeda,

5. The battle of Cul Ratha, the battle of Cua
against the Erna--no tale of tiresome falsehood-
the battle of Ard Achaid, high its fame,
in which Smirgoll son of Smethra was slain.

6. The burst of four lakes separately--
Lochs Oenbeithe, Sailech,
Cassan, and a sea-burst, in brilliant wise,
between Eba and Ros Ceite.

7. Cleared by him were seven plains
Mag Glinne Dechon of beautiful aspect,
Mag Muccrama, a long work,
Mag Cuile Cael, Mag nOensciath.

8. Aelmag, Mag Archaill of the ramparts,
and Mag Luachra Dedad;
by the fair poet with an hundred graces,
all by the learned Óengus.

Óengus Olmucaid fell at the hands of Énna Airgdech, s. Eochu of Mumu, in the battle of Carman, unde poeta cecinit--

1. Óengus Olmucaid died,
Enna son of Eochu slew him,
in the battle of Carman, with hundreds of heads,
wherein were the honourable ones of Ireland.
2. Énna who was a prince of Fal to the rampart,
it is he who apportioned to the Gaedil
steeds and chariots--it was heard,--
[and] silver shields in Argatros.

3. Let us speak of his fate after victory
on the crimson plains of Raigne
at the hands of Rotechtaid, very noble, of great knowledge,
of the son of Moen son of Fergus.

4. Giallchad was king, a prop of rank
whose son was Nuadu Finn Fail;
Sirna son of Den the beloved was king
and Rotechtaid was king.

5. Nuadu quenched--an unshared strength--
the great authority of the host of Breogan's seed;
though evil, sharp, and slender, modest his manner,
he was king of Ireland alone.

6. Thereafter comes the people of Ulaid
they took a warlike kingdom;
by them was reckoned the royal troop,
the plain of the Sons of Míl alone.

7. I believe in the mighty Trinity,
King of every royal road, very divine;
Who is, was, and shall be, over every sea,
Who is Two, Three, and One Person.

XIV. ENNA AIRGDECH.
Then Énna Airgdech took the kingship of Ireland. By him were made silver shields in Argatros, and he gave them to the leaders of Ireland. He was twenty-seven years in the kingship of Ireland, till he fell at the hands of Rothechtaid s. Maen s. Óengus Olmucaid in the battle of Raigne.

XX. OLLOM FOTLA.
Ollom Fotla s. Fíachu Finscothach in the kingdom thereafter for a space of forty years. From him is named Ulaid, "the big side" from Ollom; and by him was the Assembly of Temair first convened; and by him was the Rampart of the Scholars made in Temair. Six of his descendants took the kingship of Ireland, with no one between them. And a natural death he died alone, within his Rampart.

XXI. FINNACHTA.
Finnachta s. Ollom; there was snow of wine in his reign. Of plague he died, in Mag Inis in Ulaid. Twenty years had he in the kingdom.

XXII. SLÁNOLL.
Slánoll s. Ollom, there was no disease during his reign. And it is unknown what disease carried him off, but he was found dead [in the Midchuart House in Temair]; yet his colour changed not, and his body decayed not. He was taken from the earth by his son, Ailill, to find out [how he was], at the end of forty years; [and his body was not decayed]. He had thirty years in the kingship.

XXIII. GÉDE OLLGOTHACH.
Géide Ollgothach s. Ollom took the kingship of Ireland. Sweet as the strings of a zither was the voice and singing of every man in his reign. Fíachu s. Fíadchú slew him.

XXIV. FÍACHU FINDOILCHES.
Fíachu Findoilches s. Fínnachta, thirty years. All the cattle of Ireland had white heads in his reign. By him was built the fortress of Cúl Sibrille, that is, Cenannas. It is he who appropriated [a tax of] the white-headed cattle of Ireland. Fíachu fell at the hands of Berngal s. Géide in vengeance for his father.

XXV. BERNGAL.
Berngal s. Géide took the kingship of Ireland. It is in his reign that com failed from Ireland, for the greatness of war and he fell thereafter at the hands of Ailill s. Slánoll.

XXVI. AILILL.
Ailill s. Slánoll took the kingship afterwards, fifteen [or sixteen] years, till he fell at the hands of Sirna s. Dian s. Denol [or Damal]. Thereof Fercertne chanted--

1. Ollom Fotla, fierce in valour,
marked out the Scholars' Rampart;
the first mighty king, with grace,
by whom the Festival of Temair was convened.
2. Fifty years, it was tuneful fame,
was he in the High-kingship over Ireland;
so that from him, with fortunate freedom,
the Ulaid received naming.

3. Six kings ruled, a roll with valour
over Ireland after Ollom;
two hundred and ten years, strong in jealous;
no one came between them.

4. Finnachta, Slanoll with grace,
and Geide Oilgothach,
Fíachu, Ailill expert in arms with grace,
and the war-warrior Berngal.

5. Ollom was loftier, without reproach,
the keen son of Fíachu Finnscothach;
nobler than every king (royal his countenance)
of the children of Ir son of Míl.

6. The great progeny of Rudraige, a famous saying,
the martial heroes of Craeb Ruad,
(in their place pride took them)
this is the stock of Ollom.

7. Labraid Loingsech, sufficient his tally,
who slew Cobthach in Dinn Rig;
with a spear-armed host over the sea-pool,
whence Laigin is wont to take its name,

8. Eochu Mumo, greatest of every great one
king of Ireland, son of Mofemis,
from him is the name of Mumu so long as it endures,
the name of Ulaid from Ollom.

9. Connacht from the progeny (icht) of Conn of the Battles,
the height which every scholar knows;
a host fitting for helpfulness;
and Ulaid comes from Ollom.

XXVII. SÍRNA SOEGALACH.
Now Sírna s. Dian s. Demal s. Rothechtaid s. Maen s. Óengus, he it is who separated the princedom of Ulaid from Temair; and it was he who avenged Rothechtaid s. Maen, his father's grandfather, upon them. This is that Rothechtaid whom the Ulaid slew in treachery in Cruachu. Berngal fell then at the hands of Sírna s. Dian, along with Ailill; Ailill fell at his (Sírnás) hands thereafter. This is that Sírna who was an hundred years in battle against the Ulaid. He took the kingship thereafter. It is he who broke the battle of Aircheltra against the Ulaid, and the battle of Sliab Airbrig, and tlie battle of Cend Dúin in Asal, and the battle of Moin Foiehnig in Ui Failge against the Mairtine and the Erna. In his time hosting began in Ireland; and in his time was the battle of Móin Trógaide in Cianachta : that is, Lugair s. Lugidoth brought the Fomoire over Ireland with him. The Men of Ireland assembled to Moin Trogaide to fight against the Fomoire. When they were in the thick of the battle a plague broke out over them, so that the Men of Ireland died there, and Lugair and Ciasam the king of the Fomoire died, as well as Sirna king of Ireland, ut quiclam dicunt. But other scholars say that it was in Alinn that he fell, at the hands of Rothechtaid Roth s. Ronán, quod uerius est. Of him the poet chanted as follows--

1. Sírna Sóeglach, free the prince,
an hundred and fifty years ever good,
was his life, under a fair border
till he fell before Rothechtaid.
2. The burst of Scirthech in his time
and the burst of Duailt;
in his time there burst forth
Nith, sacred, pearly.

3. In the time of Sírna son of Dian
was the beginning of hostings, straight as rods,
everyone went forth from the land of Mide
against the race of the Fomoraig.

4. Sírna fought with ranks of spears
the battle of Cenn Duin, the battle of Airceltra,
the battle of Móin Foichnig, a lucky cause,
the two battles in Sliab Airbrig.

5. Glorious there, was the other battle
which was made in Món Trógaide,
where there fell in its floods
the men of Ireland and the Fomoraig.

6. Lugair son of Lug fell,
going round the slaughter;
and Ciasarn, even without fighting--
thereat was Sirna pleased, not displeased.

Item de eodem--

1. The battle of Moin Trogaide in the East,
where the Fomoraig fell,
he it is who gave it, at the strong mound,
Lugaid son of Lugaid the white-handed.
2. Hence is stony Moin Trogaide,
(from) the sorrowful deaths of the youths of Ireland;
and the Fomoraig yonder
without smiting of a high battle.

3. The host which came to the unlucky battle
each of them on the two sides;
darts of valour did not wound them--
they were dead on Moin Trogaide.

4. Ciasarn son of Dorcha with colour
was king of the family of the Fomoraig;
he came over Mumu abroad
with Lugair, in five battles.

5. The battle of Luachair, the battle of fair Cliar,
the battle of Samain, the battle of Cnoc Ochair,
the fifth battle, without blame,
was the battle of Móin Trógaide.

Then Sírna fell at the hands of Rothechtaid in Alind.

XXVIII. ROTHECHTAID.
Rothechtaid Rotha was seven years in the kingship of Ireland, till lightning burnt him in Dún Sobairce. By him were four-horse chariots first introduced into Ireland.

XXIX. ELIM.
Elim Olfínechta took the kingship of Ireland one year, till he fell at the hands of Giallchad s. Ailill Olcháin s. Sírna.

XXX. GÍALLCHAD.
Gíallchad took the kingship for a space of nine years. He took a hostage from every five men in Mumu; so he fell in Mag Muiaide at the hands of Art Imlech s. Elim.

XXXI. ART IMLECH.
Art Imlech took the kingship of Ireland for twelve years; and seven forts were dug by him, till Nuadu Finn Fail s. Gíallchad slew him.

Eochu Apthach of Corco Laigde s. Lugaid; or s. Art s. Éber Brecc s. Lugaid Cal; one year in the kingship thereafter. There was a plague every month in his reign, that is, twelve plagues in the year. Eochu fell at the hands of Finn s. Blath s. Labraid Condelg s. Corpre s. Ollom Fotla. Or it was of plague that he died.

XXXV. FINN.
Finn s. Blath took the kingship for a space of twenty years, till he fell at the hands of Sétna Art Inarraid s. Bres, in Mumu.

XLI. LUGAID ÍARDONN.
Lugaid Íardonn s. Énna, nine years in the kingship till he fell at the hands of Sírlam in Ráith Clochrain.

XLII. SÍRLÁM.
Sírlám s. Finn [s. Blath] thirteen years in the kingship, till Eochu Uairches s. Lugaid slew him. His arm would reach the ground when he was standing.

XLIII. EOCHU UAIRCHES.
Eochu Uairches, twelve years had he in exile over sea. This is why he was called Uairches by reason of his being driven forth by Sírlám. Other twelve years had he in the kingship, till he fell at the hands of the sons of Congal s. Lugaid Cal, namely Eochu and Conaing Bececlach. The historians are in doubt about those two, at whose hand Eochu Uairches fell, namely Eochu Fíadmuine and Conaing Bececlach. Some say that Eochu was son of Congal, and that Conaing Beceelach was son of Dui s. Muiredaeh s. Siomón; and that they had the same mother as Eochu Uairches s. Lugaid.

XLIV. EOCHU AND CONAING.

Lugaid, seven years, till he fell at the hands of Conaing Bececlach.

XLVI. CONAING.

XLVIII. AILILL FINN.
Ailill Finn s. Art, nine years in the kingship, till he fell at the hands of Airgetmar and of Fíachu, son of Dui s. Fíachu together. A battle was fought between Airgetmar and Fíachu Tolgrach in Óenach Taillten, which went against Airgetmar. A battle was fought between them in Brega, and Ílachu Tolgrach fell in that battle. The men of Mumu assembled thereafter, in the company of Eochu s. Ailill Finn, of Lugaid mac Echach Fíadmuine, and of Dui Ladrach, with the descendants of Érimón, and they drave out Airgetmar oversea for a space of seven years.

XLIX. EOCHU.
Eochu s. Ailill Finn during that time was in the kingship of Ireland, till Airgetmar came over sea and made peace with Dui Ladrach : so Eochu fell at their hands in Óenach Áine.

Lugaid Laigdech, seven years had he in the kingship till he fell at the hands of Aed Rúad s. Badarn s. Aigetmar.

[HERE IS THE DINNSHENCHAS ERENN, FOUNDATION OF MACHA --Macalister has omitted this; I've added the text from O'Curry:

What is Emain Macha named from? It is not difficult to tell? Three kings that were over Erinn in co-sovereignty; they were of the Ultonian race, namely, Dithorba, son of Diman, from Usniuch of Midhe (Meath); Aedh Ruadh, son of Bádhurn, son of Argatmar, from Tír Aedha; Cimbaeth, son of Fintan, son of Argatmar, from Finnabhair of Magh Inis. These kings, now, made an arrangement, that each man of them should reign seven years [in turn].

There were three times seven guarantees between them [namely]: seven Druids, seven poets, seven military leaders [or captains]. The seven Druids to scorch them by incantations; the seven poets to satirize and denounce them; the seven captains to wound and to burn them, if each man of them did not vacate the sovereignty at the end of his seven years; and to maintain the [evidences of the] righteousness of a sovereign, namely: abundance of fruit every year; and no failure of the dye-stuffs of every colour; and women not to die in childbirth. They revolved three revolutions each man of them in the sovereignty, that is, sixty-three [years, in all]. Aedh Ruadh was the first of them that died, i.e. of drowning, he died in Eas-Ruaidh, and his body was buried in that hill [Sidh] unde Sidh Aedha [Aedh's hill], and Es-Ruaidh [or, the Redhaired Man's Cataract]. This Aedh left no children but one daughter, Macha Mong-Ruadh [that is, Redhaired Macha] was her name. She demanded her father's turn of the sovereignty. Cimbaeth and Dithorba said that they would not give sovereignty to a woman.

There was a battle fought between them, and Macha gained the battle. She spent seven years in the sovereignty. Dithorba was killed in the Corann in that time. He left five good sons, namely, Baeth, and Bras, and Betach, and Uallach, and Borbchas. These demanded the sovereignty. Macha said that she would not resign it to them, because it was not from securities she had obtained it, but in the battle-field by force. A battle was fought between them, Macha gained the battle over the sons of Dithorba, so that they left a slaughter of heads with her; and she sent them into banishment afterwards into the wildernesses of Connacht. Macha after that took Cimbaeth to her to be her husband, and to take on him the command of her soldiers.

When Macha and Cimbaeth had thus formed an union, Macha set out to discover the sons of Dithorba, in the shape of a leprous woman, i.e., having rubbed herself with the dough of rye and rota [some kind of red colouring stuff]. And she found them in Bairinn of Connacht, cooking a wild hog. The men asked news of her, and she told them, and they gave her food at that fire. A man of them said: "Beautiful is the eye of the hag: let us cohabit with her". He took her with him into the wood. She tied that man by main strength, and she left him in the wood. She came again to the fire. "What of the man who went with you?" said they. "He was ashamed", said she, "to come back to you after cohabiting with a leprous woman". "It is no shame", said they, "for we will all of us do the same". Each man of them took her into the wood. She tied each man of them by her strength, and carried them in one tie with her to Ulster. The Ultonians proposed to have them killed. " Not so", said she, " because it would be the defilement of the righteousness of a sovereign to me; but they shall be condemned to slavery, and shall raise a Rath around me, and it shall be the chief city of Ulster for ever". And she marked for them the Dún with her brooch of gold [Eó óir] from her neck [or at her neck], i.e. Emuin, i.e. Eomuin, i.e. the Eó [brooch] of Macha at her neck. [Eó and muin, brooch and neck.]

LIII. CIMBÁETH.
Now Cimbáeth, the first prince of Emain Macha, twenty-eight years was his reign in Emain.

Cimbáeth died, unde poeta--

1. Cimbáeth, summit of the (warrior) youths of Emain
took the fruitful land of Temair;
spouse of Macha--greatness of pride--
head of battle of the Red Branch.
2. Though it was dug by noble Macha--
by the lofty daughter of Aed Rúad--
Emain of lustfulness (?), a heritage of heroes
it was Cimbáeth who was its first prince.

3. Let the historians of your possession hear--
O ye noble Ulaid of Emain!--
the names of your kings, of division of rulers
from Cimbáeth to Conchobor.

4. Cimbáeth mac Fintain from the plain,
Eochu of Emain of just knowledge,
Umanchenn mac Corrain the fair,
Conchobor Rot mac Cathair,

5. Fíachu mac Feidlimid the good,
and Daire mac Forgo,
Enna mac Rathai, it was not too soon,
and Fiacc son of Findchu,

6. Finnchad son of Bacc from his hill
Conchobor Máel son of Futhe;
Cormac son of Loichet took it,
along with Mochta son of Murchorad,

7. Eochu son of Daire from (Mag) Roth
Eochu Sálbuide son of Loch,
Fergus son of Liath with grace,
Conchobor the fair son of Cathub.

8. Four hundred mighty years--
every sage of history relates it--
was the length of their dominion--of the wise men--
from Conchobor to Cimbáeth.

9. Macha, who had the Temair-house
by whom was insufferable Emain dug,
suppressed the generation of the heroes,
extended the kingdom, before Cimbáeth.

10. Four hundred and fifty years,
every sage of free intellect relates it,
(though he see it contrary to the fact of wisdom)
till Christ was born, after Cimbáeth.

11. Fergus Foga of valorous hewing,
the last prince of Ulaid in Emain,
the fifteenth king, a strong division,
who took Emain after Conchobor.

12. The battle of the three Collas on Fernmag,
after their coming into Temair;
the prudent one after the honours of their music (?)
Fergus son of Fraochar Fortrén.

13. Empty is Emain of a hedge that polluted it not (?)
slain the king of divisions of royal castles,
a space of thrice fifty years
from the distant battle, to the Faith.

14. Nine hundred years without trouble,
a saying against the reason of the Red Branch (?)
till Fergus Foga, who was a warrior,
from [the time when] Cimbáeth was king of Coba.

15. From when Macha, with thousands of warriors,
was in Temair with Cimbáeth,
to the People of Temair-land thereafter,
who of them was contemporary?

16. From the time of Nuadu Finn of Fál
till the time of Ugaine the Great
he subdued Géde without retribution,
till Ireland was settled.

17. Dui Ladrach, wide in fame,
father of Eochu Buadach,
he it was, with no wise glorious (?) kingship,
who was of like age with Cimbáeth,

18. From when Labraid, of swiftness of spears,
slew Cobthach Cóel in Dinn Ríg,
fifty years, it is no empty judgement,
was the step of length after Cimbáeth.

This is that Cimbáeth who nurtured Ugaine Mor, s. Eochu.

LIV. MACHA.
Now Macha was seven years in the regality after Cimbáeth, till she fell at the hands of Rechtad Rigderg s. Lugaid s. Eochu s. Ailill Find s. Art s. Lugaid Lamderg s. Eochu Uairches.

LV. RECHTAID RÍGDERG.
Rechtaid Rígderg took the king-ship of Ireland twenty years, till Ugoine Mór, foster-son of Cimbáeth and Macha slew him. He it is who slew Reehtaid Rígderg, in vengeance for his foster-mother. Thereafter the princedom of the Ulaid was sundered from Temair.

LVI. UGOINE MÓR.
Ugoine the Great s. Eochu Buadach took the kingship of Ireland and of Alba to the Sea of Wight, and he took the daughter of the king of the Franks to wife, namely, Cessair Chrothach d. of the king of the Franks. And she bore twenty-five children to him, twenty-two sons and three daughters. Some say that Ugoine took the kingship of all Europe, and divided Ireland into twenty-five shares (as under). Ireland was thus divided for three hundred years, till the Provincials came, namely, Conchobor and Curoi and Eochu mac Luchta and Ailill mac Mata. Of that the historian chanted--

1. Ugoine proud and glorious,
who had the conquering palace of Banba;
divided by his children aright
was Ireland into twenty-five shares.
2. Cobthach Cóel-Breg over Bregia,
Cobthach of Muirthemne, rich in mead,
Loiguire Lore in Life,
Fuillne in Feb, no true summit (?).

3. The Nairne in Nár-plain, sparkling the place,
Fergen, born in Raigne,
Narb in Magh Nairb, slain on this side (?)
and Cuan in Airget Ros.

4. Tairr in Mag Tharra with jealousy,
and Triath in Treithirne;
Sin in Luachair--is mentioned clearly--
Bard in the harbours of Corcach.

5. Fergus Cnae in the south-land,
Ord in Aidne of lofty brightness;
Moen in Moen-magh with abundance of strength
Sanb in glorious Magh Ai.

6. Muiredach Mál in Cliu Máil,
Eochu in Seól-mag of free rank,
Letha aside over Latharna,
Marc over Mide of the Sons of Míl.

7. Laeg in Line, shining his colour,
son of Ugoine son of Eochu,
they divided that very peaceful land
those twenty-two kings.

8. Aine, Faife, white her countenance,
Muirisc from Mag Muirisce,
Aille, very white with colour,
were the three daughters of Ugoine.

9. There were six divisions of Ireland hither
which the Túatha Dé Danann had;
thereafter the surface of Fál was reckoned [surveyed]
by the sons of Míl of Spain.

10. The division of the three grandsons of the Dagda wide,
and the division of the two sons of Míl,
the division of Sobairce and of white Cermna,
was an hundred years over Ireland.

11. Three hundred years--lasting the partition--
till the Provincials came--
five men without Faith in Christ
divided the Ireland of Ugoine.

12. The division of the Provincials, sons of Coll,
the division of Mug Nuadat and of Conn--
more noble than all the divisions, for he was a king,
the sons of Ugoine divided it.

13. There active seed is not,
save only Cobthach and Loiguiri;
till the capturing by Nathí smiled
was the destroying race of Ugoine.

14. Eochu ua Floinn who found every law,
who stitched the history free and right,
a stately sage of every prosperity he,
descendant of Cobthach mac Ugoine.

Ugoine fell at the hands of his own brother, Bodbchad s. Eochu, in Telach-in-Choscair in Mag Maireda in Brega. None of the progeny of Ugoine left children, except Cobthach Cóel Breg and Loiguire Lore, and two daughters, whom Fergus Cnai left, namely, Maer and Medan. Maer was the mother of Eochu mac Luchta, and Medan nurtured him; but this cannot be true, on account of the length of the times involved. It is from Cobthach that there come the four families of Temair, Colmán, Aed Sláine, Conall and Eogan; and the three Connachta, with nine cantreds in each divisioni; and the nine cantreds of Airgialla, and the nine ciantreds of the Dessi, Fothairt and Eraind and Alban and Dál Riata and Dál Fiatach, that is, the kings of the Ulaid.

[A List of the Family of Ugoine Mor, and the Territories apportioned among them; Macalister doesn't translate this:]

LVII. LOIGUIRE LORC.
Cobthach was fifty years in the kingship of Ireland and his brother's son slew him, namely Labraid Lonn. As for Loiguire Lore himself, it is he who took the kingship of Ireland after Ugoine Mór, till Cobthach Cóel Breg slew him in treachery.

LVIII. COBTHACH CÓEL BREG.
And further the same Cobthach slew his son (this Loeguire's), namely Ailill Aine; and he exiled Labraid Lonn s. Ailill s. Loiguire Lore over sea, till he made peace with him, at the end of thirty years and gave him the province of the Gailian, namely Laigin. From that onward was there war between Leth Cuind and Laigin. Then Cobthach Cóel Breg fell in Dinn Ríg, with thirty kings around him, on Great Christmas night, at the hands of Labraid Loingsech, in vengeance for his father and his grandfather. Three hundred and seven years from that night to the night when Christ was born in Bethlehem of Juda.

LIX. LABRAID LOINGSECH.
Labraid Loingseeh took the kingdom of Ireland for a space of nineteen [aliter thirty] years. There was vengeance upon the children of Cobthach in the time of Labraid Loingsech, till Labraid fell at the hands of Melge Molbthach, s. Cobthach.

LX. MELGE.
Meilge took the kingship of Ireland. From hira is Loch Melge in Coirpre named. When his grave was dug it is there that the lake burst over the land. Melge fell at the hands of Mac Corb s. Mac Rechtada in Mumu.

LXI. MUG CORB.

[Macalister's Note.— This and the following reigns are filled with interpolations from the narrative of the Boroma, the tribute imposed upon the province of Leinster by Tfiathal Techtmar as a recompense for the death of his two daughters, in consequence of the trickery of Eochu mac Echach DoimUin, king of that province, and levied by his successors in Temair for some 500 years. The text was edited by Whitley Stokes, without reference to the extracts here incorporated, although they contain numerous variae lectiones worthy of the attention of an editor. It would, indeed, be possible to reconstruct an almost complete text, differing in many respects from Stokes's version, from the fragments inserted, especially in the W text in the Book of Lecan. They appear to he makeshift repairs of gaps in Reim Riograide, and Jiave no radical connexion with it; they are therefore here omitted, as due regard will have to he paid to them in any future revision of Stokes's text--now over fifty years old--of the Borama saga. The verse extracts, which Stokes omits from his edition, must await that publication : they would here he irrelevant.]

Eithne Imgel, daughter of the king of Alba, escaped over sea. She was pregnant, and in; the East she brought forth Túathal s. Fíachu. She nurtured him for twenty years in the East, and his mother came back with him. She landed at Inber Domnann, and bandits of Ireland came to meet her there, to wit, Fíachra, Cassa'n, and Finnmall, with a company of eight hundred warriors. They gave him [Túathal] the kingship immediately, and he broke thirty battles against Mumu, twenty-seven againsit Laigin, twenty-eight against the men of Mumu, and twenty-eight against Connachta--an hundred and twenty-three in all. The Assembly of Temair was convened by him thereafter. The men of Ireland came there, with wives, sons, and daughters. Túathal took sureties of sun, moon, and every power in heaven and earth, that though the Provincials of Ireland might be equal in power, they should not be equal in right of Ireland with the progeny of Tuathal, but that his progeny should have the kingship for ever.

So Tuathal fell in Dál Araide in the Bog of Battle, through treachery, in the place where Ollar and Ollarba broke forth, at the hands of Mai s. Rochraide king of the province, after completing an hundred and ten years in the kingship. But thirty years was he in the kingship of Ireland.
