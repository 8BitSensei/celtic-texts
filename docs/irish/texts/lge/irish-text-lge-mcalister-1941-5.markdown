#### §65-95: The Milesians

<br>
§65. The taking of the Gaedil and their synchronizing, here below. As for the Gaedil, we have given their ventures from Iafeth s. Noe onward, and from the Tower of Nemrod, till we have left them at Breogan's Tower in Spain; and how they came from Egypt, and out of Scythia to the Maeotic Marshes, and along the Tyrrhene Sea to Crete and to Sicily; and we have further related how they took Spain by force. We shall now tell you below simply, how they came to Ireland.

§66. Íth s. Breogan, [it is he] who saw Ireland at the first, on a winter’s evening, from the top of Breogan’s Tower; for thus is a man’s vision best, on a clear winter's evening. Íth, wÍth thrice thirty warriors, came to Ireland, and they landed on the “Fetid Shore” of the Headland of Corcu Duibne, what time they arrived.

If we follow the Munster authorities, this is their route. tth came thereafter into Corcu Duibne, into Ciarraige Luachra, into Luachair Dedad, into tim plain of Cliu, into Eile, into Tir Cell, along Mide, into the Territory of Luigne, over Sliab Guaire, past the woods of Fernmag, into Fossad Cláir of Fernmag, over the head of Shah Betheeh, into Shah Toad, into the swamp of Tir Sirláim, into the Territory of Modorn, into Mag Ítha, across the head of Loch Febail, into the Land of Net, to Ailech of Net. But, according to the Northerners, he sailed, as we have said, to Ireland, and landed on the “Fetid Shore” of Mag Iftha, on the Northern side of Ireland.

§67. People came to hold converse wÍth him on that strand, and each of them told their tidings mutually, through the Scotic language; fitting was that, seeing that on both sides they were of the progeny of Rifath Scot. tth asked of them what was the name of this island. Inis Elga, said they; Mac Cuill, Mac Cécht, and Mac Gréine are its three kings.

Who is its king? said Íth. They answered; (a) Mae Cuill, Mac Cécht, and Mac Gréine are the names of the three kings that are over it. [Now others say that it was shepherds who first met him, and gave him tidings.] Íth asked, Where those kings were! They said that Cathair Crofind - was the place where they were. Howbeit, that is not where they were--at the moment, but—-

§68. There was in fact a convention of the men of Ireland at Ailech of Net, after the slaying of Net s. Innui of Ailech by the Fomoire. The three kings were dividing the cattle and the treasures of the king of Aileeh at the time. Íth s. Breogan came from Corco Duibne, into Ciarraige, and into Luacliair Dedad, into the lowland of Clíu, thence Northward into the Éiles, into the land of Fir Cell, along Mide, into the terri­tory of Luigne, over Sliabh Guaire, over the woods of Fernmag, into Fossad Cláir: of Fernmag, over the head of Sliabh Bethech, into Sliabh Tóád, into the Swamp of Tír Sírláim, into the territory of Modorn, into Mag nÍtha, to Ailech Néit. The three kings, Mac Cuill, Mac Cécht, Mac Gréine, were there, and they welcomed him (i.e. Íth s. Breogan), and told him the matter that was occupying them.

§69. Íth surpassed the judges of Ireland in cunning and in argument; and lie settled every matter and every dispute that was before them. Then said Íth: Work just righteousness, for good is the land wherein ye dwell; plenteous its fruit, its honey, its wheat and its fish; moderate its heat and its co1d. WÍthin it is all that bade them farewell, and ye need. Thereafter he made for his ship, bade them farewell, and made for his ship.


§70. [The first night afterwards [when] Íth went into Ireland after Ins arrival at Loch Sailech], demons slew one of his followers. He is the first who was slain in Ireland there, of the progeny of the Sons of Míl. Every harbour whereto tth would come in Ireland, after coasting every territory where it was, Mag Ítha is its name; Mag ftha at Lock Febail, the Lands of Íth at Locli Sailech, Mag Ítha among the Déssi, Mag Ítha at Luimnech.

§71. It is then that a plot was laid by them to kill Íth, and they bade him begone out of Ireland; and he came away from them, from Ailech Mag Ítha. There was a pursuit after him as far as that, and he fell at their hands in Mag Ítha; unde Mag Ítha nominatur. So it was to avenge Íth that the sons of Míl [to wit, the Gáedil] came--for his [Íth's] body was carried to Spain.

§72. Now, this is what learned men relate; that thirty-six leaders and nobles strong the Gáedil came. [Each of them had a ship, which makes thirty(-six) ships.] And four-and-twenty ser­tors had they, each of whom had a ship; and four-and-­twenty servitors along with every servitor in every ship, again.

These are the six and thirty chieftains who came into Ireland as Fintan s. Bochra recorded (who was born seven years before the Flood; till seven years of the reign of Diarmait mac Cerbaill, that was his [Fintan’s] life) under the nurture of Finnian of Mag Bile, and of Colum Cille, and as Túan mac Cairill recorded in the presence of the Irish, and of Finnian of Mag Bile, and as their pupils related, to wit Ladcend s. Bairche, and Colmán s. Comgellán, and Cenn Fáelad s. Ailill, and Senchan a. Colmán, Cú Alad from the Cruachans, and Bran of Boirenn, etc. Those are the pupils of Finnian and of Túán.

And what they said was, that these are the thirty-six chieftains who entered Ireland as the Gaedil, namely the ten sons of Bregon (Íth being one of them)—Brego, Bile, Blad, Cualu, Cuailnge, Fúat, Muirthemne, Eibleo, Íth, Nár: the single son of Bile, Míl of Spain (Galam was his proper name): the seven sons of Míl, Donn, Colptha, Amorgen, Éber, Ír, Érimón, Érech Febria and Érennán, the youngest of the family. The three sons of Érimón; Muimne, Luigne, Laigne; also Palap and Írial Fáid (but in Ireland itself was Írial born) the son of Érimón.

And he is called Nuadu Airgetlám. Nuadu Airgetlám had two sons, Glas a quo Síl nArgetrois, and Fir Nuadat; and they took the princedom over Ireland; for Nuadu was not in partnership with them, for he was a youth, and there was no disturbance of division among them, on account of his piety to his brethren; but he used to feed and clothe every child born to him, and he suppressed the children of the one and enlarged those of the other for their piety; for what learned men say is, that every princely family that is in Ireland, save the Eoganacht, is of the seed of Nuadu Airgetlám.

Another family is reckoned as having been born to Érimón in Ireland, namely Alan, Eidenn, Aine, Caithiar, Caitheair, Cerna.

The four sons of Éber Finn, Ér, Orba, Ferón, Fergna.

And learned men reckon that lie had children in Ireland, to wit Conmáel s. Éber, who took the kingship of Ireland and of Alba, and Caur, Corand, Edar, Airb, Airbe. The ten champions further, Caicher, Fulmán, Mantán, Sétga, Suirge, Sob­airche, Én s. Oice, Ún s. Uice, Étán, Goisten.

Or they were three son of Nár s. Breogan, and Gosten was the brother of Setga.

Those are the names of the ten champions; Bres, Búas, Buaigne, the three sons of Tigernbard s. Brigi s. Breogan.

Or perhaps Brigi s. Brig had a son Bile.

And there came also Lugaid s. Ith, the hard valorous powerful warrior, to avenge his father. So that those are the company of chieftains who came into Ireland with the Sons of Míl, the ten sons of Breogan, and the eight sons of Míl, the five sons of Érimón, and the four sons of Éber Finn, and the ten champions. And there came thither Gosten and Sétga and Íth s. Breogan. And learned men say that Míl came not into Ireland; and others say that the three kings died of plague before coming into Ireland, namely Míl s. Bile, and Oige. and Uige, the two sons of Allod s. Noenel.

The twenty-four servitors as under; Aidne, Al, Assal, Mede, Morba, Mide, Cuib, Clíu, Cera, Saer, Slán, Life, Line, Ligen, Traig, Dul, Adal, Aire, Dése, Dela, Fea, Femen, Fera.

Moreover Lugaid s. Íth came also, the hard valorous warrior with the strength of an hundred, to avenge his father along with them all.

Those are the names of the chief servitors, these are the names of the subordinate sbrvitors below, who are not very prominent in the books: Medar, Ladar, Medon, Pida, Cath, Ruis, Cailna, Mad, Dena, Caeha, Bonn, Finnu, Cer, Coirche, Meadba, Ailim, Bir, Baschon, Forena, Lugba, Sega, Seilgenn, Seg, Mar, Aig. They say that Éber had sons besides these, Caur, Capa, Corunn, Edor, Arb, Airrbe,. Éremón had other six sons, Edenn, A[l]an, Ailie, Caichear, and Caieher Cernda; and that family is not usually brought into prominence.

§73. One of the eight Sons of Míl, Érannán, the youngest of the family, he it was who went up the mast to spy out Ireland, and fell from the mast into the sea [on to the rock, F.]. And his grave is in Inber Scéne, and the grave of Scéne wife of Amorgen on the other side. She died on the sea at their estuary, and Amorgen said: The harbour wherein we shall land, shall bear the name of Scéne. The sons of Míl made a contention in rowing as they came to Ireland from the place where they saw Ireland away from them; and Ír son of Míl advanced the length of a murchrech [possibly the mythical "nine waves" --MJ] beyond every ship. Éber Donn, the eldest of the family, was envious, and he said—

It is not lucky
that Ír leapeth beyond Íth,

—[that is, beyond Lugaid son of Íth]. Then the oar that was in the hand of Ír broke, so that he fell backward, and died in the following night; and his body was taken to Sceilic, behind the Southern promontory of Corco Duibne.

Every time that the Sons of Míl came up with Ireland, the demons would frame that the port was, as it were, a hog’s back; whence Ireland is called “Hog island”. They skirted around Ireland three times, and landed at last in Inber Scéne.

Sorrowful were Éber Finn and Érimón and Amorgen after the death of their brother; and they said: It were right that Éber Donn should have no share of the land, regarding which he was envious of his brother Ir. On the morrow Scéne and Érannán were buried in Inber Scéne. They two were both buried; their mounds and their graves are still there, side by side. Then said Amorgen—-

Though it be the grave of Scene—so it was [hitherto]— 
(but the name of Scene shall remain upon it) 
it shall be the grave of Erannán, till he come, 
from God came the death of this poet.

§74. As he set his right foot upon Ireland, Amorgen Glúingel s. Míl spoke this poem— 

I am Wind on Sea,
I am Ocean-wave,
I am Roar of Sea,
I am Bull of Seven Fights,
I am Vulture on Cliff,
I am Dewdrop,
I am Fairest of Flowers,
I am Boar for Boldness,
I am Salmon in Pool,
I am Lake on Plain,
I am a Mountain in a Man,
I am a Word of Skill,
I am the Point of a Weapon (that poureth forth combat),
I am God who fashioneth Fire for a Head.
Who smootheth the ruggedness of a mountain?
Who is He who announceth the ages of the Moon?
And who, the place where falleth the sunset?
Who calleth the cattle from the House of Tethys?
On whom do the cattle of Tethys smile?
Who is the troop, who the god who fashioneth edges
in a fortress of gangrene?
Enchantments about a spear? Enchantments of Wind?

Item Amorgen cecinit—-

A fishful sea!
A fruitful land!
An outburst of fish
Fish under wave,
In streams (as) of
A rough sea!
birds,
A white hail
With hundreds of salmon,
Of broad whales!
A harbour-song— 
An outburst of fish,
A fishful sea!

At the end of three days and three nights thereafter the Sons of Míl broke the battle of Sliab Mis against demons and Fomoraig, that is, against the Túatha Dé Danann. It is there that Fás (sic lege) fell, the wife of Ún s. Uicce, after whom “the grave of Fás” is named, between Sliab Mis and the sea.

Scota d. Pharao king of Egypt, also died in that battle—the wife of Érimón s. Míl. For Míl s. Bile went a-voyaging into Egypt, four ships’ companies strong, and he took Scota to wife, and Érimón took her after him. In that night on which the sons of Míl came into Ireland, was the burst of Loch Luigdech in Iar-Mumu.

"Shah Mis"—that means the worst mountain which they found after coming into Ireland, for there they fought their first battle in Ireland.

§75. Lugaid s. Íth was bathing in Loch Luigdech; Fial, wife of Lugaid, bathed in the river that flows out of the lake. Her husband went to her naked, and she saw the nakedness of her husband, and died for shame. Unde Loch Luigdech, and Fial, and Inber Féile nominantur.

§76. The Sons of Míl fought the battle of Life; there were monsters in shapes of giants which the Túatha Dé Danann had summoned to themselves by druidry. The Sons of Míl (Éber, Érimón and Ír), fought the battle valiantly. The horse (gabar) of Érimón fell there, unde Gabar Life rwminatur. They came thereafter till they were in the mountain over against [Loch] Dergderc.

§77. The sons of Míl had colloquy with Banba in Sliab Mis. Said Banba unto them: If it be to take Ireland ye have come, not right were the good-fortune in which ye have come. It is by necessity, said Amorgen Glúingel, the poet. A gift from you to me then, said she. What gift? said they. That my name may be on this island, said she. What is thy name? said they. Banba, said she. Let it be a name for this island, said Amorgen.

The Book of Druim Snechta says that Amorgen enquired after her race. Of the progeny of Adam am I, said she. Which race of the sons of Noe is thine! said he. I am older than Noe, said she; on a peak of a mountain was I in the Flood; to this present mound the waves of the Flood attained. Therefore is it called Tul Tuinne? [But the foregoing is a surprising extract.] Thereafter they sing spells against her, and drive her away from them.

§78. They had colloquy with Fotla in Eblinne. She spake with them in like manner, and desired that her name should be upon the island. Said Amorgen: Let Fotla be a name upon this island.

§79. They had colloquy with Ériu in Uisnech. She said unto them: Warriors, said she, welcome to you. Long have soothsayers had [knowledge of] your coming. Yours shall be this island for ever; and to the east of the world there shall not be a better island. No race shall there be, more numerous than yours. Good is that, said Amorgen; good is the prophecy. Not right were it to thank her, said Éber Donn, eldest of the sons of Míl; thank our gods and our own might. To thee ‘tis equal, said Ériu; thou shalt have no profit of this island, nor shall thy progeny. A gift to me, ye sons of Míl, and ye children of Breogan, said she; that my name shall be on this island. It shall be its principal name, said Amorgen.

The Book of Druim Snechta says that it was in Sliab Mis that Ériu had colloquy with them, and that she formed great hosts to oppose them, so that they were fighting with them. But their druids and poets sang spells to them, and they saw that these were only sods of the mountain peat-mosses. (Thence comes the name Sliab Misse.) And that it was Fotla who had colloquy with them in Uisnech.

§80. The sons of Míl and of Bregon went on, till they were in Druim Chain, that is, Temair. The three kings of Ireland, Mac Cuill, Mac Cécht, and Mac Gréine, were there. They pronounced judgement against the Sons of Míl, that they [themselves] should have the island to the end of three days, free from assault, from assembly of battle, or from giving of hostages; for they were assured that they (the invaders) would not return, because druids would make spells behind them, so that they should not be able to come again. We shall adjudge it, said Mac Cuill s. Cermat, as Amorgen your own judge shall pronounce to you; for if he should give a false judgement, he [aliter, you] would die at our hands. Give the judgement, Amorgen, said Eber Donn. I pronounce it; said Amorgen. Let this island be left to them. How far shall we go said Éber.. Past just nine waves, said Amorgen. This is the first judgement given in Ireland. Amorgen cecinit—-

Men, seeking a possession!
Over nine great green-shouldered waves, 
Ye shall not go, unless with powerful gods!
Be it settled swiftly! Be battle permitted!

I adjust the possession
Of the land to which ye have come; 
If ye like it, adjudge the right, 
If ye like it not, adjudge it not—
I say it not to you, except with your good will.

§81. They came southward from Temair as far as Inber Féile and Inber Scéne, for it is there that their ships were. Then went they out, past nine waves. The druids of Ireland and the poets sang spells behind them, so that they were carried far from Ireland, and were in distress by reason of the sea. A wind of wizards is this! said Éber Donn; look ye whether it—the wind—-be over the mast. And it was not. Patience! said Airech, steersman of the ship of Donn, till Amorgen come (Airech was the fosterling of Amorgen). They all went forward, till they were in one place. Said Donn, the eldest, This is a disgrace for our men of cunning, said he. ‘Tis no disgrace! said Amorgen; and he spake—-

I seek the land of Ireland, 
Coursed be the fruitful sea, 
Fruitful the ranked highland,
Ranked the showery wood,
Showery the river of cataracts,
Of cataracts the lake of poois,
Of pools the hill of a well,
Of a well of a people of assemblies,
Of assemblies of the king of Temair;
Temair, hill of peoples,
Peoples of the Sons of Mll,
Of Mil of ships, of barks;
The high ship Eriu,
Eriu lofty, very green,
An incantation very cunning,
The great cunning of the wives of Bres,
Of Bres, of the wives of Buaigne,
The mighty lady Eriu,
Erimón harried her,

—and a calming of the wind came to them forthwith.

§82. Said Donn: I shall now, said he, put under the edge of spear and sword all that are in Ireland. And the wind rose against the ship wherein were Donn and Airech, two sons of Mil, and the ship wherein were Bres, Búas, and Buaighne; so that they were drowned at the Sandhills at Tech Duinn. The grave-mound of each man is there. And there, as some say, Díl, wife of Donn, was drowned. She was a daughter of Míl, and Érimón himself laid a sod upon her. This is a sod over Díl, said he. Unde Fotla nominatur, ut quidam putant.

§83. Howbeit, Odba d. Míl, mother of the three sons of Érimón, of Muimne, Luigne, and Laigne, she it is whom Érimón deserted in Spain, taking Tea in her stead. But Odba came from the South in a ship, along with her sons, and they maintained her till she died in Odba. Unde Odba [dicitur]. As for Tea d. Lugaid s. Íth, she it was whom Érimón took instead of Odba; and she was to choose a mound in Ireland as her bridal portion. This is the marriage-price which she chose, Druim Chain, the mound which is Temair; Temair is Tea Mur, “the Wall of Tea (d. Lugaid s. Íth).” Lugaid means Lug Íth, that is, “Lug, who was less than his father.”

§84. Éremón with thirty ships sailed right-hand-wise against Ireland to the North-east. These are his chieftains: Brego, Muirthenme, Fáat, Cuailnge, Érimón, Éber s. Ír, Amorgen, Colptha, Muimne, Luigne, Laigne, Gosten, Sétga, Suirge, Sobairche. Further, these are the fourteen servitors: Ai, Mdne, Assal, Mide, Cuib, Cera, Sér, Slán, Ligen, Dul, Adal, Traig, Line. Of them the historian sang—

Meadon, Meadair, Caeh, Dala, 
Lotan, Pita, Cath, Cuanna,
Rus, Calna, Mag, is Deana, 
Cacha, Bonn, Findu, Buada.

They landed in Inber Colptha; that is, Colptha s. Míl, he it is who landed at first, so that it is his name which is on the harbour; unde Inber Colptha.

§85. As for the Sons of Breogan, they left no descendants, only their names upon the noble fortresses of Ireland.

§86. There is no progeny reported of the warriors, Sétga, Gosten, Sobairche, and Suirge. Of Amorgen is Corcu Achrach in Éile, and the Orbraige, and Corcu Airtbinn, and Corcu Airtbi.

§87. Éber s. Ír, of him are the progeny of Ollom Fotla and of Rudraige; all the Ulaid are of his progeny. Of his progeny are Conmaicne, Ciarraige, Corcomruad, and Corcu Duibne; Dál Moga Ruith (i.e Fir Maige Féne) and Laigse of Laigin, Arad Chliach and the seven Sogains.

§88. As for Érimón, the leader of the expedition, of him is Leth Cuinn, i.e. the four families of Temair—-Conall, Colmán, Eogan, and Aed Sláine. Of him are the three Connachta, and Airgialla, Laigin, and Osraige, the Déssi of Mumu, and the Ernai of Mumu, of whom were the progeny of Deda, as well as Conaire the Great with his children (the men of Alba and of Dál Riata); and the Muscraige, and Corco Baiscinn. And of the Ernai of Mumu are Dál Fiatach, the kings of Ulaid; those are the progeny of Érimón. Of them also are the Fotharta, of whom came Brigit, and Fintan of Cluain Eidnech, Ui Ailella, and IJi Cheocháin. Of the Fotharta are all those. [Those are all the progeny of Érimón].

§89. Éber remained in the South [with] thirty ships. These are his leaders—Bile, Míl, Cualu, Blád, Ebliu, Nár, Éber Donn, Éber Finn, Airech, Érannán, Lugaid, Ér, Orba, Ferón, Fergna, Én, Un, Etán, Caicher, Mantán, Fulmán. These are the servitors, of whom each man had a ship; Adar, Aire, Déisse, Dela, Clíu, Mórba, Fea, Life, Femen, Fera.

§90. Bile and Míl, of their progeny are all the Gáedil. Cualu and Blad and Ebliu left no progeny, only their names upon important mountains. Nár s. Bile, a quo Ros Náir. No progeny of the warriors is recorded, that is, of Ér, Étán, Caicher, Fulmán, Mantán. Éber Donn and Airech left no children, for they were drowned, as we have said. The four sons of Éber, Ér, Orba, Ferón, Fergna, had no children. They had a half-year in the kingship of Ireland, till Íriel slew them.

§91. Lugaid s. Íth, five peoples came of him, to wit the family of Dáire Doimthech, namely the five Lugaids—Lugaid Cal, a quo the Calraige of Connachta, Lugaid Corr a quo the Corpraige, Lugaid Corp a quo Dál Coirpre of Cliu ut alii dicunt, Lugaid Oircthe a quo Corcu Oircthi, Lugaid Láeg, a quo Corcu Láegde; of whom was the son of Dairine, Lugaid mac Con. Ailill Ólom it is he who nurtured him; and he could not sleep with any save with Elóir, a hound which Aiiill possessed.

§92. As for Éber Finn, of his progeny are Dál Cais, and Dál Cein, and Delbna, and the Northern Déssi, and Dál Moscorb, ut quidam putant; Dál Mathra, hUi Derduib, Cathraige, Éile, and Túath Tuirbi; and the Eoganacht of Caissel, of Áme, of Loch Loin, of Ráithlinn, of Glenn Amain, of Ara, and of Ros Airgit. Those are all the seed of Éber.

§93. There was a contention between the sons of Míl concerning the kingship, that is, between Éber and Érimón. Amorgen was brought to them to arbitrate between them, and he said: The heritage of the chief, Donn, to the second, Érimón; and his heritage to Éber after him. But Éher would not accept that--only a division of Ireland. These are the first three judgements that were given among the sons of Míl in Ireland: the judgement that Amorgen gave in Temair, and that decision in Sliab Mis, and the decision that Amorgen gave in Cenn tSáile in Mumu upon the deer and roes and quadrupeds; as the poet said—

There did Amorgen give the judgement 
his neighbours conceal it not; 
after the battle of Mala, a fame without decay, 
between the hosts of the Sons of Mil.

To each of them he apportioned his right, 
as they were a-hunting;
each one received his lawful due at his hands,
by the judgement of Amorgen, high and great.

The first wounding of stags, it is known, 
be it a man or a hound that tears the skin, 
to the stag-hounds, customary without fail, 
there comes what is cast to them. (?)

The share of the skinner, so he [Amorgen] apportioned it,
a gulp (?) of the short brief neck; 
to the coursing-dog the legs of the stag, 
his should be a part that is not increased

The inward parts to the man who comes last, 
whether he thinks the course good or bad, 
it is certain that he is not entitled, 
from it, to shares in the co-division.

A general division to everyone 
thereafter—it is no vain course— 
without commanding hither or thither 
this is the judgement that Amorgen gave.

§94. In the end there were six chieftains southward and seven chieftains northward who came there; and Éber had the kingship southward and Erimón the kingship northward. The six in the South were Éber himself, Lugaid s. Íth, Étán s. Oicce, Ún s. Uicce, Caicher, Fulman. The seven in the North were Érimón, Éber s. Ír, Amorgen, Gosten, Sétga, Sobairce, and the seventh rwas Surge. Of these matters did Roigne the poet speak, the son of Ugoine the Great, to Mál son of Ugoine his brother, when Mál asked him: Sing of thine expedition. Then is it that Raigne said— 

Noble son of Ugoine,
How attains one to full knowledge of Ireland?
He arose from Scythia,
Did Feinius Farsaid himself;
Nél reached Egypt,
Remained awhile faithfully
With Pharao in journeys.
A betrothal of Nél, of Scota,
The conception of our father Gáedil,
The surname of “Scot” spread abroad
Did the fair daughter of Pharao.
The people of the Good God arrived together
With smiting of a great host.
Cincris was extinguished,
Drowned in the Red Sea.
They voyaged the sea-surface
Arrived at Scythia,
Which Eber Scot harried;
They smote Refioir,
Did Agnomain, Lamfind.
They sailed over Caspian
Entered on Liuis,
Made for Toirrian,
Followed on past Africa,
Arrived at Spain,
Where were conceived Erimon,
And Eber to Mile.
Soon Brego, Bile,
For avenging of Ith,
Grouped in their barks,
Sixty their number.
The men as they returned
Divided Ireland
Among twice six chieftains.
Let the truth of the history suffice!
I answer the question keenly.

§95. Or they say that they were twice six men, namely the six sons of Míl and the six sons of Breogan—Érimón, Éber, Lugaid, Amorgen, Colptha, Ír; Brego, Bile, Fúat, Blad, Cualu, Cuailnge. In this wise did the Gáedil take Ireland; finit of the Takings of Ireland down to this.
